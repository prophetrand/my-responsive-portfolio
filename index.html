            <p>My name is Rand Hale and I am an aspiring programmer/web developer. I have a number of friends in the industry who excitedly await my transition to this career field, and have been beyond encouraging in my effort to gradually enter the programming fray. I am currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area, but I hope to move to Los Angeles within a year.</p>
            <p>In my free time I enjoy cooking, being around dogs, and playing video games with friends who have moved around the country, or the world! In each of these activities I believe there is great value in sharing them with others, but I also just enjoy them for me. I also love music and have sporadic binge sessions of finding new stuff to listen to.</p>
